 <p class="w3-large w3-panel w3-padding w3-left w3-margin">
   Bibliography Manager is a tool specially designed for the researcher for
   collecting and organizing literature. The application is capable of storing a
   metadata about the research paper, books, journals and other publications.
   Researcher can create their own libraries which will contain metadata about
   different references. Also, researchers can share their libraries with other
   researcher with specific permissions.

 <h2 class="w3-wide" style="text-align:center;">DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
 <p class="w3-large w3-panel w3-padding w3-left w3-margin">
 <b>User research:</b>
We, as a team, conducted user research by asking some of our colleagues and students at the college to use similar web tools that are used for citing references for academic and research work. Apart from predefined requirements for the project mentioned under challenges section in this article, we made sure that we address the main problem that the users are facing using similar tools, and we want to make sure we solve that problem in our website.
 </p>
 <p class="w3-large w3-panel w3-padding w3-left w3-margin">
 <b>Conceptualization and User flow:</b>
 From conducting user interviews on the existing research and academic reference tools, we were able to analyse the data and created two personas. One is for a student, and other is for a researcher. After discussing how the two different personas use the website we are about to develop, we came up with a user mental model which helped us develop a rough user flow before we created a paper wireframe.
</p>
<p class="w3-large w3-panel w3-padding w3-left w3-margin">
<b>User Interface design and development :</b><br>
Due to the tight schedule, we first made a priority that we meet all the requirements of the client. So, first, we created a fully functional prototype of our website and conducted usability testing on one student who seemed to be a better match for both of our personas. We took a brief note during usability testing and analysed the results. We immediately made the required changes to our design, and the usability of our site improved.
